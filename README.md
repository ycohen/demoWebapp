## Demo webapp

Here's a demo webapp I wrote for a prospective employer.

It was built using Javascript, Java with Jersey runing on Tomcat, and is backed by a MariaDb database.

I wrote it in Intellij Idea.

I've rewritten it to strip out the employer's name, so the timestamps on the commits reflect the new project
